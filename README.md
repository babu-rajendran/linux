## Modifying instruction behavior in KVM
### Questions

#### 1. For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailing what parts of the lab that member implemented / researched. (You may skip this question if you are doing the lab by yourself).
I did it by myself.

#### 2. Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment.
For this assignment, I wanted to try the option of using Google Cloud even though I have a dual boot setup with macOS and Ubuntu. I followed the steps given in the link provided below to quickly get an instance of Ubuntu running on GCP with nested virtualization enabled.

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances

To summarize, here are the steps to spin an instance in GCP with nested virtualization.

Step: 1

```gcloud compute disks create ubuntu-disk --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts --zone us-central1-a```


Step: 2

```gcloud compute images create nested-vm-image --source-disk ubuntu-disk --source-disk-zone us-central1-a --licenses "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/vm-options/global/licenses/enable-vmx"```


Step: 3

Spin up an instance with the created "nested-vm-image".

SSH into the instance and run the following commands:
This will install the necessary pacakges and dependencies for building the kernel.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential kernel-package fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache bison flex libelf-dev
```

Check out the Linux source code.
Also check the kernel version.

Change directory to the linux source code and copy the config file as shown in the screenshot.

Run "make oldconfig" and press the Return key for all the prompts so that the default options are enabled.

Run this command to compile and build the kernel from source. Since my instance has 4 cores I have given the option "-j 4" with the make command to speed up the process.

```
sudo make -j 4 && sudo make modules -j 4 && sudo make install -j 4 && sudo make modules_install -j 4
```

Once the build is successful reboot the instance.

After reboot, verify that the kernel version has been upgraded.

Once changes are made to any Linux kernel module, they can be loaded and removed using the insmod and rmmod command as described in the assignment 1 and only those modules which have been modified need to be built again.

Install the packages necessary to create a nested VM

#### 3. Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
